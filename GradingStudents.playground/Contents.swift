/*
 HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

 Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
 Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
 Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

 If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
 If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
 Examples

  grade = 84 round to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
  grade = 29 do not round (result is less than 40)
  grade = 57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
 Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

 Function Description

 Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.

 gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

 int grades[n]: the grades before rounding
 Returns

 int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate
 Input Format

 The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of students.
 Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[i].

 Constraints
 1 <= n <= 60
 0 <= grade[i] <= 100
 
 Sample Input 0

 4
 73
 67
 38

 Sample Output 0

 Student 1 received a 73, and the next multiple of 5 from 73 is 75. Since 75 - 73 < 3, the student's grade is rounded to 75.
 Student 2 received a 67, and the next multiple of 5 from 67 is 70. Since 70 - 67 = 3, the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 67.
 Student 3 received a 38, and the next multiple of 5 from 38 is 40. Since 40 - 38 < 3, the student's grade will be rounded to 40.
 Student 4 received a grade below 33, so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 33.
